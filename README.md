<p align="center"><a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img width="100" src="https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png" alt="Vue logo"></a></p>

## What is this?
```
It is a simple todolist project that uses Vue JS.
*Its features include:*
- Has task weightage that allows you to effectively understand how much work is completed
- Has projects that can group your tasks into categories for better management
- Has a built-in pomodoro timer that measures a count down for 25 minutes and then rings a bell.
```

#### How to get started?

```
git pull git@github.com:guylil/todo-list-vuejs.git
cd todo-vue
npm install
npm run serve
open your browser @ localhost:8080
```

 ### Future Plans and Roadmap:
 - I want to make a desktop version of this using Electron JS
- Revamp the UI. I should use a tool like Figma to plan ahead what I want
- Tasks should also have a due date feature and should mark the tasks with an exclamation symbol once something goes overdue
- I plan to add an agile /scrum board that can help us track projects.
